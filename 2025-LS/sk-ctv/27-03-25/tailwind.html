    <p class="p-6 text-base/6 font-bold bg-green-400">Whales are magnificent marine mammals that belong to the order Cetacea, which also includes dolphins and porpoises. They are known for their massive size, complex behaviors, and impressive migratory patterns. Whales are divided into two suborders: Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales). Whales are incredibly intelligent and exhibit behaviors like complex social structures, migrations that span thousands of miles, and even unique songs (especially in humpback whales). Some species, like the orca, are highly social and live in family pods, while others, like the sperm whale, are more solitary.

     
     
        
     
        Conservation efforts to protect whales are critical, and organizations worldwide are working on preserving whale habitats, preventing ship collisions, and combating the effects of pollution. Whales have become symbols of marine conservation, representing the delicate balance of our ocean ecosystems.</p>
